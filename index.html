                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                      
                        <p>I am a curious person that is always trying to learn new hobbies and understand the world. I am multi-lingual and speak 2 languages fluently (English and Spanish) and plan on learning more French, Italian, and Portuguese. I studied abroad in Spain back in 2014 for six months. It was the best experience in my entire life. In the past year, I have traveled abroad, gotten certified in scuba diving, and learned how to knit. My favorite hobbies are surfing, scuba diving, traveling, and meeting new people. In addition, I plan on learning how to build websites, mobile apps, programs, and translating them as well. Here is my educational background about me that I will list in my "About Me" section. I started off at a local community college, then transferred to Pace University in New York City. After attending Pace, I took a year off and explored different career options. After discovering that I wanted to pursue translation, I applied to NYU and completed my master's degree in Spanish to English translation. I took classes in legal translation as well as localization. I decided to pursue localization since it involves translating websites and changing content, therefore, I decided to become a coder.</p>
