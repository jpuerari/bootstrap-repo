          <p>I am a curious person that is always trying to learn new hobbies and understand the
            world. I
            am multi-lingual
            and speak 2 languages fluently (English and Spanish) and plan on learning more French, Italian, and
            Portuguese.
            I studied abroad in Spain back in 2014 for six months. It was the best experience in my entire life. In the
            past
            year, I have traveled abroad, gotten certified in scuba diving, and learned how to knit. My favorite hobbies
            are
            surfing, scuba diving, traveling, and meeting new people. 
            In addition, I plan on learning how to build
            websites,
            mobile apps, programs, and translating them as well. Here is my educational background about me that I will
            list
            in my "About Me" section. I started off at a local community college, then transferred to Pace University in
            New
            York City. After attending Pace, I took a year off and explored different career options. After discovering
            that
            I wanted to pursue translation, I applied to NYU and completed my master's degree in Spanish to English
            translation. I took classes in legal translation as well as localization. I decided to pursue localization
            since
            it involves translating websites and changing content, therefore, I decided to become a coder.</p>
